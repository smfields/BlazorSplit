> Blazor wrapper around the [Split.js](https://github.com/nathancahill/split) library.

- Zero Deps
- Fast: No overhead or attached window event listeners, uses pure CSS for resizing.
- Unopinionated: Only compute view sizes. Everything else is up to you.

## Credits
This project is simply a port of an existing JavaScript library. It would not exist without the hard work of those that contribute to the base Split.js library.
